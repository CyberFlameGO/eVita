\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, the results have shown that with this dataset it is possible to come up with a predictor that is able of classifying adherent users correctly in 74\% of the cases. This predictor is based on the first session of a specific user. We have seen that by using linear regression on the predictors of the number of days between the first and second session, and the second and third session, it is not possible to obtain a significantly correct result. The correlation coefficient was very close to zero, meaning that a good correlation for the obtained formula could not be guaranteed.
